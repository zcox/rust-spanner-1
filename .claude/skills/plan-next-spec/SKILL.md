study specs/README.md

Ignore complete specs, and specs with planned tasks. 
Identify the next highest priority spec that is not fully planned yet. 
Verify that the spec's tasks/README.md contains tasks, and that the task files actually exist.
Use the plan-spec-tasks skill on that spec to plan out its tasks.
