study specs/README.md

Your job is to identify the next task to implement. You MUST NOT write any code.

The specs should be listed in priority order. Find the next spec that needs to be implemented. There may already a spec In Progress, or you may need to choose the next highest priority spec to work on.
Within that spec, find the next single task that needs to be implemented. Don't assume implemented or not-implemented. Explore the code in subagents as needed.
Return only the task file you identified: specs/{spec-name}/tasks/{task}.md.
