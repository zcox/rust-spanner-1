description: Choose the next highest priority task to implement.
context: fork
---

Identify the next task to implement, as quickly as possible, starting with specs/README.md. You MUST NOT write any code.

The specs should be listed in priority order. Find the next spec that needs to be implemented. There may already a spec In Progress, or you may need to choose the next highest priority spec to work on.
Within that spec's spec/{spec-name}/tasks/README.md file, find the next single task that needs to be implemented.
Return only the task file name you identified: specs/{spec-name}/tasks/{task}.md.
